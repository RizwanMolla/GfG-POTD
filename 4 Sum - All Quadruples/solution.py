"""
Summary:
The solution sorts the array and uses two nested loops combined with a two-pointer technique to efficiently find all unique quadruples that sum up to the target. Duplicate quadruples are avoided by skipping repeated elements during iteration. The time complexity is O(nÂ³), and the space complexity is O(1) (excluding the output list).
