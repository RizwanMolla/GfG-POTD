        Count pairs (a, b) where a from mat1, b from mat2, and a + b = x
        
        Approach: Since both matrices are sorted in a special way where each row
        is sorted and last element of row < first element of next row, we can
        treat each matrix as a single sorted array and use two pointers.
        
        Time Complexity: O(nÂ²) - we traverse both flattened arrays once
        Space Complexity: O(1) - only using pointers
