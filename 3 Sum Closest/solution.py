"""
Summary:
The solution uses sorting and a two-pointer approach to efficiently find the closest sum to the target. By comparing both absolute differences and sum values, it ensures the maximum closest sum is returned in case of ties. The time complexity is O(nÂ²), and the space complexity is O(1).
